# Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to deliver, within the eight-week project timeline, a functional, interactive UBCO campus map with a room schedule and details viewer that simplifies navigation and helps users to quickly locate classrooms, buildings, and services. The application will feature at least five campus buildings on the map, with each building linked to a room details viewing page. Room schedules will be populated with either sample data or real data if available, and the system will be designed to support dynamic updates. An event listing feature will be included that is capable of displaying updates with a maximum delay of one minute. The platform will also implement role-based access with three levels of permissions: students, faculty and staff, and administrators. It will also be mobile-friendly and accessible, allowing users to easily interact with it from any device. To ensure usability, the team will conduct user testing with at least ten respondents, aiming for a minimum of 80 percent of participants to report that the system is easy to use.

# Project Scope
In-scope: The project will design and deploy a web-based, interactive map. The map will allow users to locate buildings, services, and facilities, and will integrate information about upcoming campus events directly on the map. The platform will feature a dynamic design that is accessible on both desktop and mobile devices. Users will be able to search for buildings, rooms, and events, and apply basic filters to refine their results.
Out-of-scope: The project will not integrate with official room or event booking systems. Real-time GPS navigation beyond location services will also be outside of the scope of this project.

# Tech Stack, Database & Libraries
Tach Stack: React for frontend, Javascript with Node JS for the backend. We will use SQLite for the database. To worl with the map we will use Leaflet, a third party JS library for interactive map.
