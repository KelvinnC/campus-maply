## 1. Selected Project

Our team has selected an **Interactive Campus Map** as our project. The platform allows users to explore the UBCO campus, locate buildings and services, and view upcoming events. The goal is to create a practical and engaging tool that supports navigation and the sharing of important campus information.

## 2. Rationale

### 2a. Meeting Project Constraints 
The interactive campus map fulfills all of the required project criteria. It is a web-based application, 
with defined roles for students and visitors (viewing locations, services, and events), faculty and staff 
(updating room or office information and posting events), and administrators (managing and verifying 
content). The website will have a role-based login system with three levels of permissions, where 
conditional rendering of features controls what each role can see (e.g., staff only sees “Edit 
Department Info,” while admin sees “Manage All Departments”). Dynamic pages will display building 
and event information, updating in real time to reflect important or changing campus details. The 
website will be hosted online to meet deployment requirements. With three developers working five 
hours per week, the core features (map, markers, event details, role-based access) are achievable 
within the eight-week timeline. Stretch goals, such as indoor routing, can be added if time permits.

### 2b. Business Needs
Our web application will allow users to efficiently navigate our confusing campus. The users will be 
empowered with a tool that can reduce their time travelling and help them arrive on time to their 
classes, meetings, and campus events. The platform will provide real-time updates on events, 
detours and room changes. By centralizing campus locations, opening times,and  event schedules 
with one accessible interface, people on campus can focus on what they really need to—STUDYING!

### 2c. Stakeholders
The primary stakeholders for the interactive campus map and room booking system include students, 
whose adoption will determine the success of the project as it provides them with reliable access to 
room availability and booking for study or group use; club and student organization leaders, who 
benefit from easier event planning and the ability to match their needs with available spaces. 
Administrators, who hold high influence by managing availability, permissions, and policies across 
buildings and room types; and faculty and staff, who use the system to book classrooms and labs 
with priority access to ensure academic schedules are met while still allowing other users to access 
remaining spaces.

### 2d. Project Vision
The interactive campus map and room booking system provides a centralized, user-friendly platform 
that gives students, faculty, staff, and club leaders real-time access to room availability and the ability 
to book spaces with ease. Combining an intuitive map interface with a streamlined booking process, 
the system will reduce scheduling conflicts, improve transparency, and increase the efficiency of 
space utilization across campus. The goal is to improve the student experience, support academic 
and extracurricular activities, and allow administrators better oversight and control of campus resources.
