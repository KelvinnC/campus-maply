Action Items: Overview of last week’s activity and this week's assigned items. James requested documentation for APIs. Store data in `seed.sql`. Update schema as required. Focus on gathering GPS and attribute data for buildings, attribute data for rooms, washrooms, bus stops, and parking lots. Rooms and buildings should be separate in the database, to be done later on in the project. We are not generating room lists for residences.
